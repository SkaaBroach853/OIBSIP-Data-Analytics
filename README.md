## 🗂️ Projects Overview

### ✅ **Project 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis on Retail Sales Data**
**Goal:** Analyze retail transaction data to uncover trends in sales, customer demographics, and product performance.

**Key Tasks:**
- Checked for missing values and duplicates
- Analyzed daily total sales, gender-based spending, age distribution
- Identified top 10 product categories
- Used correlation heatmap for numeric relationships

**Libraries:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`

---

### ✅ **Project 2 – Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering**
**Goal:** Group customers into clusters based on behavior to support personalized marketing.

**Key Tasks:**
- Standardized the data using `StandardScaler`
- Reduced dimensions using `PCA` for visualization
- Applied KMeans clustering and determined optimal `k` using the Elbow Method
- Visualized clusters and analyzed average profile of each segment

**Libraries:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`, `numpy`

### ✅ **Project 3 – Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes Classifier**
**Goal:** Classify tweets as Positive, Neutral, or Negative using machine learning.

**Key Tasks:**
- Cleaned and mapped sentiment labels from numeric to text
- Transformed text data into vectors using `CountVectorizer`
- Trained and evaluated a `MultinomialNB` (Naive Bayes) model
- Visualized confusion matrix and printed classification report

**Libraries:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`

### ✅ **Project 4 – Data Cleaning of NYC Airbnb Dataset**
**Goal:** Clean the New York City Airbnb dataset to prepare it for analysis.

**Key Tasks:**
- Dropped irrelevant columns and handled missing values
- Removed duplicates and outliers
- Renamed and standardized column names
- Exported clean dataset for further use

**Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`
